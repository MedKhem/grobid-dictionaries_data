# Fang-French (FangFr) & French-Fang (FrFang) Dictionary

The Fang-French & French-Fang dictionary (Galley, 1964) is a bilingual dictionary gathered in one volume that has over 500 pages of lexical entries split into two parts. The dictionary was published in 1964 but later digitised and the PDF version we used has a medium OCR quality. For our experiments, we consider the first part FangFr, containing over 390 pages, to be a separate dictionary from the second part FrFang, with over 140 pages.
